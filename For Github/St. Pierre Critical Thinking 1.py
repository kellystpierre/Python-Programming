# Ask the user for input.
num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

total = num1 + num2
print("Sum: ", total)
difference = num1 - num2
print("Difference: ", difference)

# Part 2: Find the multiplication and division of two numbers.
product = num1 * num2
print("Product: ", product)
quotient = num1 / num2
print("Quotient: ", quotient)
